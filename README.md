This C++ project simulates a food ordering system for De Anza College's food court. The main purpose is to allow users to order different types of burgers, calculate the total cost including tax (if applicable), and print as well as save a receipt of the order. The program differentiates between students and staff, applying a tax only to staff orders. It includes features for displaying a menu, taking user input for order options and quantities, calculating the bill, printing the receipt, and saving the receipt details to a text file with a unique filename.
